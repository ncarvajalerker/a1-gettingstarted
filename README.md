This project shows a demonstration of manipulating html code and appl;ying css cofde to sylize my webpage.

### Design Achievements
- **Re-vamped Apple's Design Philosophy**: Shown in the style section of my head, the code is able to control the color and opacity of the background and text. In order to get the opacity, i found a color, reverted it to the rgb decimals, and added an opacity.
